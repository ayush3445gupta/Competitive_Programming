The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>Pikachu is a cute and friendly pokémon living in the wild pikachu herd.</p><p>But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pokémon! Pokémon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pokémon army to resist.</p><p>First, Andrew counted all the pokémon — there were exactly $$$n$$$ pikachu. The strength of the $$$i$$$-th pokémon is equal to $$$a_i$$$, and all these numbers are distinct.</p><p>As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $$$b$$$ from $$$k$$$ indices such that $$$1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$$$, and his army will consist of pokémons with forces $$$a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$$$.</p><p>The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $$$a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$$$.</p><p>Andrew is experimenting with pokémon order. He performs $$$q$$$ operations. In $$$i$$$-th operation Andrew swaps $$$l_i$$$-th and $$$r_i$$$-th pokémon.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Note: $$$q=0$$$ in this version of the task.</span></p><p>Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pokémon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.</p><p>Help Andrew and the pokémon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.</p><p>The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$$$) denoting the number of pokémon and number of operations respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) denoting the strengths of the pokémon.</p><p>$$$i$$$-th of the last $$$q$$$ lines contains two positive integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) denoting the indices of pokémon that were swapped in the $$$i$$$-th operation.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$. </p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print $$$q+1$$$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id00972518845783202" id="id009983442907863137" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id00972518845783202">3
