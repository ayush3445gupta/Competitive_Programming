There are $$$n$$$ cupcake types, arranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ on the shelf, and there are infinitely many of each type. The tastiness of a cupcake of type $$$i$$$ is an integer $$$a_i$$$. There are both tasty and nasty cupcakes, so the tastiness can be positive, zero or negative.</p><p>Yasser, of course, wants to try them all, so he will buy exactly one cupcake of each type.</p><p>On the other hand, Adel will choose some segment $$$[l, r]$$$ $$$(1 \le l \le r \le n)$$$ that does not include all of cupcakes (he can't choose $$$[l, r] = [1, n]$$$) and buy exactly one cupcake of each of types $$$l, l + 1, \dots, r$$$.</p><p>After that they will compare the total tastiness of the cupcakes each of them have bought. Yasser will be happy if the total tastiness of cupcakes he buys is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">strictly</span> greater than the total tastiness of cupcakes Adel buys <span class="tex-font-style-bf">regardless of Adel's choice</span>.</p><p>For example, let the tastinesses of the cupcakes be $$$[7, 4, -1]$$$. Yasser will buy all of them, the total tastiness will be $$$7 + 4 - 1 = 10$$$. Adel can choose segments $$$[7], [4], [-1], [7, 4]$$$ or $$$[4, -1]$$$, their total tastinesses are $$$7, 4, -1, 11$$$ and $$$3$$$, respectively. Adel can choose segment with tastiness $$$11$$$, and as $$$10$$$ is not strictly greater than $$$11$$$, Yasser won't be happy :(</p><p>Find out if Yasser will be happy after visiting the shop.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ represents the tastiness of the $$$i$$$-th type of cupcake.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>", if the total tastiness of cupcakes Yasser buys will always be <span class="tex-font-style-bf">strictly</span> greater than the total tastiness of cupcakes Adel buys regardless of Adel's choice.
