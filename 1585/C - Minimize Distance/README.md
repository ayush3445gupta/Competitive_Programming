Thus, the following is a solution sequence that gives a minimum travel distance: $$$0 \to 2 \to 0 \to 4 \to 0 \to 3 \to 0 \to 1 \to 0 \to 5$$$, where each $$$0$$$ means you go the origin and grab one bag, and each positive integer means you deliver the bag to a depot at this coordinate, giving a total distance of $$$25$$$ units. It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.</p><p>In the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: $$$0 \to 6 \to 8 \to 7 \to 0 \to 5 \to 4 \to 3 \to 0 \to (-5) \to (-10) \to (-15)$$$, with distance $$$41$$$. It can be shown that $$$41$$$ is the optimal distance for this test case.</p></div>
